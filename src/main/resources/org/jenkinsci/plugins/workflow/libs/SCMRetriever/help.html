    Loads a library from any SCM plugin supported by Jenkins Pipeline, for example in the <code>checkout</code> step.
    Not all version expressions may be supported, no prevalidation of versions is available,
    and you must manually configure the SCM to refer to <code>${library.THISLIBNAME.version}</code>.
